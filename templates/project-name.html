            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved the design, construction, and programming of an autonomous mobile robot. 
                The primary goal was to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using a 2D LiDAR 
                sensor and the Robot Operating System (ROS). The rover can explore an unknown indoor environment, 
                build a map, and localize itself within that map in real-time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Duration:** 12 weeks</li>
                <li>**Team Size:** 3 (My Role: Lead Robotics Software, Mechanical Integration)</li>
                <li>**Technologies:** ROS (Noetic), Python, C++, RPLiDAR, Raspberry Pi 4, Arduino, SolidWorks</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mechanical Design & Fabrication</h2>
            <p>
                The rover chassis was designed in **SolidWorks** to accommodate all electronic components, 
                including the Raspberry Pi, motor drivers, battery, and LiDAR sensor. Emphasis was placed 
                on modularity and ease of assembly. Components were primarily 3D-printed using PLA.

                A key challenge was designing a robust differential drive system with sufficient torque for various floor surfaces, 
                while also ensuring precise encoder feedback for odometry calculations.

            <h2>Software Implementation (SLAM & Navigation)</h2>
            <p>
                The software stack was built entirely on **ROS Noetic**, leveraging existing packages for LiDAR data processing 
                (RPLiDAR driver) and motor control (custom Arduino node).
