            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As a member of Combat Robotics at Berkeley, I collaborated with a team of six to design, CAD, and build a 15lb metal combat robot. The project was completed over a 4-month timeline with a budget of $1500.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary contributions were in mechanical design and manufacturing, specifically engineering the drivetrain, invertibility, and fabricating custom axles. I also assisted in component selection for the Bill of Materials (BOM) and CADing the frame.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Duration: 4 Months (Approx. Dec 2024 - April 2025)</li>
                <li>Team Size: 6 Students</li>
                <li>Budget: $1500</li>
                <li>My Role: Mechanical Designer (Drivetrain), Machinist, Systems Integration</li>
                <li>Tools & Tech: Fusion, Manual Lathe, Manual Mill, Drill Press, GD&T, 3D Printing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mechanical Design & CAD</h2>
            <p>
                My lead design role was engineering the robot's drivetrain. A key requirement was invertibility, meaning the robot had to be fully functional even when flipped upside-down. I designed the system in CAD to ensure the wheels would maintain contact with the ground in either orientation, protecting the chassis while remaining mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also assisted in CADing the main structural frame and spearheaded the creation of the comprehensive BOM, streamlining our acquisition of all mechanical and electrical components.

            <h2>Manufacturing & Assembly</h2>
            <p>
                I took a hands-on role in manufacturing several critical components. My main responsibility was fabricating the custom weapon and drive axles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the manual lathe and tapping tools, I cut steel stock to precise lengths, drilled holes, and tapped them. Then, using a CNC mill and tapping tools, I created tapped threads for our weapon hub. Simillary, I also tapped the wheels and Aluminum drive axles.

            <h2>Results & Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Our team successfully completed the robot within the budget and timeline, and it passed all safety and functionality checks for competition. The invertible drivetrain I designed performed exceptionally well, allowing the bot to remain a threat even after being flipped.

                [cite_start]This project was an invaluable experience in applying core engineering design principles [cite: 11] to a real-world problem. [cite_start]It solidified my skills in **CAD**, **hands-on machining** (lathe, mill) [cite: 39][cite_start], and **team coordination**. [cite: 12] Balancing design tradeoffs—like durability vs. weight—was a constant challenge that taught me a great deal about the complete engineering lifecycle.
