            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As part of Combat Robotics at Berkeley, this was my introductory project to design, CAD, and build a 1 lb plastic antweight battle bot we called Somersault. This project was my first real-world application of engineering design and served as my primary learning ground for CAD and 3D printing.

            <h2>CAD & Mechanical Design</h2>
            <p>
                My main role was to design the robot's chassis and internal mounting systems. This project is where I learned the fundamentals of CAD for manufacturing.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Main Frame:</strong> I assisted in designing the main 3D-printed body, making sure the main frame and top plate could be attached properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Motor Encasements:</strong> I designed precise internal mounts for both the drive and weapon motors. This was critical for keeping the motors secure and stationary during high-impact operation, preventing misalignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wheel Placement:</strong> I was responsible for the placement of the wheels and drive motors, ensuring the robot was balanced and the drivetrain was protected.

            <h2>Systems & Calculations</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond the CAD, I also handled a key calculation for the weapon system. I was responsible for the pulley and belt calculations to ensure our horizontal spinner would achieve the desired speed and torque. This involved selecting the right pulley diameters and belt length to work with our chosen motor.

            <h2>Results & Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Our team successfully built and competed with the robot, all within the $100 budget. This project was a foundational experience for me. It was my first time taking a design from a concept to a physical, functioning machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned the entire workflow of CAD to 3D Printing to Assembly, including designing for tolerances and integrating electronic components into a custom-designed chassis. The skills I learned here in CAD and 3D printing  were directly applied to my later, more complex projects, like the 15lb metal robot.
