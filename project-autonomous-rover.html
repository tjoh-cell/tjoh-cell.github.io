            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to design and build a rover that could autonomously follow a preset path and perform environmental scans. On subsequent passes, it would compare new scans to the stored "primary" scan to detect differences (like a new object in its path) and alert the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system was built using three ESP32 microcontrollers: a Home ESP32 to send commands, and two on the rover to handle movement and scanning. My primary role focused on the rover-side software, controls, and sensor integration.

            <h2>My Contribution: Software & Controls</h2>
            <p>
                I was responsible for developing the majority of the code for the two rover-side ESP32s. This involved integrating all the hardware components and ensuring they worked together.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>PID Control:</strong> I implemented a PID control algorithm to regulate the DC motor velocity. This was critical for accurate path-following, as it used feedback from the wheel encoders to correct for movement and turning errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scanning System:</strong> I programmed the scanning logic, which controlled a servo motor to sweep a dual-ultrasonic sensor array.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data & Comms Logic:</strong> I engineered the data-sending logic for the scanning system. The rover would take 62 distance/angle measurements and transmit them as an array of floats back to the Home ESP32 for analysis using the ESP-NOW protocol.
                </li>

            <h2>Results & Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>
                The rover was successful in demonstrating all the core functionalities. It could follow a path, execute scans, and send data back for comparison. We also successfully implemented the PID controller, which significantly improved movement consistency over simple-timed commands.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the project also highlighted several real-world engineering challenges:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Over longer distances, small encoder errors would accumulate, causing the rover to drift. We also found that different floor textures would cause the wheels to slip during turns, affecting calibration.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> The 250-byte limit of ESP-NOW restricted our scan density. We could only send 62 float values, which sometimes led to false positives if a few measurements were missed. Furthermore, sending raw int values would have been more efficient as opposed to floats and allowed us to double the amount of scans we could take.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project was a fantastic learning experience in system integration, PID tuning, and sensor limitations. It taught me how to debug complex, multi-component systems and the importance of accounting for real-world inconsistencies (like floor friction) in robot design.
